### Introduction
> [!NOTE]
> This project aims to provide a secure and seamless identity verification process using facial recognition technology.
### Installation and Setup
``` bash
pip install flask
```
``` bash
pip install dlib
```
```bash
pip install cmake
```
```bash
pip install face_recognition
```
```bash
git clone https://github.com/khashayardadashi/face-id.git
```
### Face Recognition Algorithm
> [!TIP]
> This project is written using haarcascades artificial intelligence algorithm

### Developed tools
> [!NOTE]
> This program is written using Python's Flask framework, along with the OpenCV library and the Haar Cascade artificial intelligence algorithm.
