### Face Recognition Algorithm
> [!TIP]
> This project is written using haarcascades artificial intelligence algorithm

### Developed tools
> [!NOTE]
> This program is written using Python's Flask framework, along with the OpenCV library and the Haar Cascade artificial intelligence algorithm.

### how to use?
> [!IMPORTANT]
> To use, you need to place the following JavaScript code in your static JavaScript file.
